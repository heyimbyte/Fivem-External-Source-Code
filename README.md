Greetings, fellow coders and enthusiasts! I am Byte, and I am excited to share with you today a cheat I've developed for FiveM. As part of our coding community, I believe in the power of collaboration and sharing knowledge. However, I must address a concerning trend that has been brought to my attention.

It has come to my notice that some individuals are not only taking my source code but also augmenting it by adding a key authentication system, and unfortunately, they are profiting from this derivative work. This issue strikes at the heart of ethical coding practices, and I believe it is essential for us to discuss and rectify such behavior.

Let's reflect on the importance of respecting each other's work. Coding is an art, and each creation is a manifestation of creativity and effort. Instead of taking shortcuts, let's encourage one another to learn and understand the intricacies of coding. This not only benefits us individually but also contributes to a healthier and more supportive coding community.

To those engaging in this practice, I implore you to reconsider. The joy of coding is not just in the final product but in the journey of creation. Instead of relying on the work of others, take pride in developing your skills and contributing something unique to our community.

In light of these developments, I am reaching out to you, my fellow coders, to bring attention to this issue. Let's foster an environment where collaboration is genuine, and knowledge is shared with respect and integrity. If you have thoughts on this matter or questions about the source code I'm sharing, I welcome you to join the conversation on Discord at: heyimbyte.

Thank you for your time and commitment to the coding community. Together, we can build a space where innovation flourishes, and ethical practices prevail.
